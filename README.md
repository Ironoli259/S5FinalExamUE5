# S5FinalExamUE5
By Olivier Grenier

Issue 1:
  In the BC_ExamCharacter, I added the ActorBeginOverlap event leading to the Interact function of the package. Since the cube has implements the interface, it executes the Interact function.

Issue 2:
  In the BC_ExamGameMode, I edited the existing _ValidateGameCodeCorrectness function to return if the code is correct. I added a for Each loop to validate if the code entered is the same as the correct code. It will return true if it completes the loop and return false if it detects a difference.
